# Parking_Violations_Visual_Analysis
Using the data of parking violations in New York City for Fiscal Year 2021 (included July 2020 - June 2020 data). In this exploration, I have used various python libraries to try out the visuals and to explore all the features available in data. To make it more usable and analysis oriented, added the borough data and police precincts data.


The parking_violation data is used from NYC open data website for the fiscal year 2021.
